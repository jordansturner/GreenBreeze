		<h5 class="sourceBody">Around 15 percent of the world's food is now grown in urban areas. According to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), urban farms already supply food to about 700 million residents of cities, representing about a quarter of the world's urban population. By 2030, 60 percent of people in developing countries will likely live in cities.</h5>

		<h5 class="sourceBody">Despommier explained that plants consist of water, mineral nutrients like potassium and magnesium taken from the soil (or, in the case of a vertical farm, from the nutrients added to the water their roots are sprayed with), and carbon, an element plants get from the CO2 in the air and then convert by photosynthesis into sucrose, which feeds the plant, and cellulose, which provides its structure.</h5>

		<h5 class="sourceBody">The U.S. imports some 35 percent of fruits and vegetables, according to Bain & Co., and even leafy greens, most of which are produced in California or Arizona, travel an average of 2,000 miles before reaching a retailer. In other words, vegetables that are going to be appealing and edible for two weeks or less spend an awful lot of that time in transit.</h5>

		<h5 class="sourceBody">It is estimated that the total annual cost of erosion from agriculture in the USA is about US$44 billion per year, i.e. about US$247 per ha of cropland and pasture. Only about 3% of the global land surface can be considered as prime or Class I land and this is not found in the tropics. Another 8% of land is in Classes II and III. This 11% of land must feed the six billion people today and the 7.6 billion expected in 2020.

		<h5 class="sourceBody">During the past 40 years nearly one-third of the world's cropland (1.5 billion hectares) has been abandoned because of soil erosion and degradation. The United States is losing soil 10 times faster -- and China and India are losing soil 30 to 40 times faster -- than the natural replenishment rate. As a result of erosion over the past 40 years, 30 percent of the world's arable land has become unproductive. About 60 percent of soil that is washed away ends up in rivers, streams and lakes, increasing the risks of flooding and intensifying water contamination from fertilizers and pesticides runoff.

		<h5 class="sourceBody">The crops, livestock, and seafood produced  in the United States contribute more than $300 billion to the economy each year. U.S. farms supply nearly 25% of all grains (such as wheat, corn, and rice) on the global market. This direct effect of rising CO2 on the nutritional value of crops represents a potential threat to human health. Human health is also threatened by increased pesticide use due to increased pest pressures and reductions in the efficacy of pesticides.

		<h5 class="sourceBody">Aeroponics systems can reduce water usage by 98 percent, fertilizer usage by 60 percent, and pesticide usage by 100 percent, all while maximizing crop yields. Plants grown in the aeroponic systems have also been shown to uptake more minerals and vitamins, making the plants healthier and potentially more nutritious.

		<h5 class="sourceBody">According to the USDA, the average yield for outdoor conventional lettuce production in 2015 was about 30,000 pounds per acre. Indoor greens growers reported growing an average of 340,000 pounds per acre annually. In comparison, on a revenue basis alone, indoor horticulture is about 4,000x more productive than conventional outdoor commodity farming; indoor cannabis is about 9,000x more productive.

		<h5 class="sourceBody">Growing your own food saves household expenditures on food; lower income citizens in developing countries generally spend a substantial part of their income (50 - 70%) on food. Urban agriculture may take place in locations inside the cities (intra-urban) or in the peri-urban areas. The activities may take place on the homestead (on-plot) or on land away from the residence (off-plot), on private land (owned, leased) or on public land (parks, conservation areas, along roads, streams and railways), or semi-public land (schoolyards, grounds of schools and hospitals).

		<h5 class="sourceBody">On average, fifteen percent of a city's land was deemed vacant. This total includes widely varying types of land, ranging from undisturbed open space to abandoned, contaminated brownfields. Cities with low proportions of vacant land tended to have high numbers of abandoned structures. The Northeast region, with the lowest reported percentage of vacant land, reported the highest number of abandoned structures (7.47 per 1000 inhabitants).
